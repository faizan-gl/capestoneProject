Problem 1: Command to initialise the terraform while using "s3" backend (need to run only once)
    $ terraform init -backend-config="access_key=<your access key>" -backend-config="secret_key=<your secret key>"
        -> Simple '$ terraform init' will give the error for the first time:
             Error: error configuring S3 Backend: no valid credential sources for S3 Backend found.
        -> Once the above command run for the first time, simple '$ terraform init' command will work fine

Problem 2: How to pass variable's value during runtime?
    $ terraform plan -var="accessKey=<value>"  -var="secretKey=<value>"
    $ terraform apply -var="accessKey=<value>"  -var="secretKey=<value>" -auto-approve
    $ terraform destroy -var="accessKey=<value>"  -var="secretKey=<value>" -auto-approve

    -> This method is used when we need to keep some confidential information 
        safe by not assigning value to the variable in the terraform file.
